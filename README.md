Open Source Community: This application is a tool where you can test out JavaScript without having to create the Page Interaction event handler just to do it.

While this is an open source project on the kCura GitHub account, support is only available through through the Relativity developer community. You are welcome to use the code and solution as you see fit within the confines of the license it is released under.
